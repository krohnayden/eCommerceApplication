## Description

The eCommerce application is a backend application viewable in Insomnia. The user can view, add, update, and delete products along with the products category and description tags. Through making this application I learned more about models and object relationships like one-to-many or one-to-one. 

## Installation

To install the eCommerce application, first ensure that you have installed node modules using the "npm i". This will install the default node modules needed for inquirer. 

## Usage

Next, in the command line enter "npm run seed" to seed the sample data in the database. Next, run "npm start" to start the local host server. Once the local host is connected, open Insomnia and type in "http://localhost:3001/api/products". You can replace products with any route you wish to visit.
